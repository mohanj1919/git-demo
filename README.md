Bootstrapped a new project.

lets get coding!

# TODOs

1. understand the problem and domain
1. decide on the tech stack considering available resources
1. come up with a POC
1. build a initial MVP for a demo
1. get first customer
1. get customer's feedback
1. improve the product based on the customer feedback

Oh! frist lets brainstorm the problem and solution.

lets document the entire design discussion in git so that future devs can catch up quickly!

notes:

1. provide review comments without publishing them to the server
1. offline sharable code review
1. helps teams to quickly finish the code review
